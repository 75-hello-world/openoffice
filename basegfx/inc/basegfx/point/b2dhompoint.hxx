		This class provides access to homogen coordinates in 2D.
		For this purpose all the operators which need to do specific
		action due to their homogenity are implemented here.
		The only caveat are member methods which are declared as const
		but do change the content. These are documented for that reason.
		The class is designed to provide homogenous coordinates without
		direct access to the homogen part (mfW). This is also the reason
		for leaving out the [] operators which return references to members.

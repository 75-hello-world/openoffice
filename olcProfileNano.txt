                         NANO BRANCH FOR PROFILE ANALYSIS
                         ================================
                         
This branch is for snalysis of the profile.c (and profile.cxx) code that may
be vulnerable to race and threading issues.  The initial problem is the
mutex unlock operation against a NULL pointer identified in bugzilla issue
<https://bz.apache.org/ooo/show_bug.cgi?id=126669>.

The approach is to make copies of only the essential files and their unique
dependencies.  Those files will be used in a collaborative analysis and will
be annotated to establish the essential repairs and also the identify the
conditions that are satisfied in having the repair work.

BASE MATERIALS

The essential materials are in the olcProfileNano/ branch subtree:

   sal/      The trunk/main/ folder extracted from
      /inc   the headers related to the code under analysis
         osl/   relevant headers included via #include "osl/..." 
         rtl/   relevant headers included via #include "rtl/..."
         sal/   relevant headers included via #include "sal/..."
      /osl   the source code for sal/osl/ functions
         unx/   the *nix-specific implementations of sal/osl/
         w32/   the Windows32-specific implementations of sal/osl
         
The folders provide marked-up annotations and possibly additional text.

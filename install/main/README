Building Apache OpenOffice
===========================

    Apache OpenOffice is a big project and depends on several other external libraries
    and the list of prerquisites is varying for the differnet platforms. 

    A comrephensive and complete building guide can be found in the project wiki under

    http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/Building_Guide

    Here you can a complete list of prerequisites

    http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/Building_Guide/Build_Requirements

    and platform specific guides for

    Windows: 
        http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/Building_Guide/Building_on_Windows
    Linux: 
        http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/Building_Guide/Building_on_Linux
    Mac OS X: 
        http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/MacOSXBuildInstructions
    Solaris: 
        http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/Building_Guide/Building_on_Solaris

    With having all prerequisites in place you can simply run

    cd main
    ./configure <configure_switches>
    ./bootstrap
    cd instsetoo_native/util
    ./build --all

    The default build will produce a setup version (e.g. setup program on windows, dmg on Mac OS, 
    rpm and deb packages on Linux, pkg packages on Solaris) and an archived version. The output
    can be found in the <output> directory in instsetoo_native/<output_dir>/OpenOffice/...

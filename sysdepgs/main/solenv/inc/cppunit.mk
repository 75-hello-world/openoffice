# Helper makefile additional, to support
# dmake test
# for cppunittester (cppunit testing)
# for simple start all generated libraries:
# dmake test
#
# for library 1 & 2:
# or dmake test1 test2

# This file have to be unroll by
# cat cppunit.mk | mkunroll >_cppunit.mk
# all between begin and end will repeat n times (at the moment n=10) to create such iterations
# $(TNR) is the number
# $(SHL$(TNR)TARGETN) is the same like $(OUT)/bin/$(SHL1TARGET) for every number, within unix, "bin" is replaced by "lib"

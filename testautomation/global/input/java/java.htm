    <h1>A Clock (1.6)</h1>
    <hr>
    <applet code="Clock.class" width=170 height=150>
      alt="Your browser understands the &lt;APPLET&gt; tag but isn't running the applet, for some reason."
      Your browser is completely ignoring the &lt;APPLET&gt; tag!
</applet>
      <p>
        The clock applet now has three parameters; the background
        color (bgcolor), the main foreground color (the hands and
        dial) (fgcolor1) and the secondary foreground color (the
        seconds hand and numbers) (fgcolor2).  These three parameters
        are hexadecimal RGB numbers (like the ones used for the body
        bgcolor tag in HTML).  For example:
      <p>
        &lt;applet code="Clock.class" width=170 height=150&gt;<br>
        &lt;param name=bgcolor  value="000000"&gt;<br>
        &lt;param name=fgcolor1 value="ff0000"&gt;<br>
        &lt;param name=fgcolor2 value="ff00ff"&gt;<br>
        &lt;/applet&gt;<p>
        would give you a black background, a red dial and hands, and purple numbers.
      <p>
        For those who don't convert to hexadecimal easily, here are some common
        values:
      <ul>
        <li>black = 000000
        <li>blue = 0000ff
        <li>cyan = 00ffff
        <li>darkGray = 404040
        <li>gray = 808080
        <li>green = 00ff00
        <li>lightGray = c0c0c0
        <li>magenta = ff00ff
        <li>orange = ffc800
        <li>pink = ffafaf
        <li>red = ff0000
        <li>white = ffffff
        <li>yellow = ffff00
      </ul>

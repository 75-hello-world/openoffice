# This file defines the list of extensions that are preregistered or bundled with the pack sets.
# At first office start the installation of extensions is completed.

# file:// URLs are interpreted relative to the solver/340/<platform>/bin/ directory to which 
# built extensions are delivered by default.

# http:// URLs can be prefixed by an MD5 checksum.  If that is present then it is an error if
# the file pointed to by the URL has a different MD5 checksum.


# Some extensions that are (or are not) installed indepently of the language.
